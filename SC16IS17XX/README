A proof of concept to talk to a sc16is750 spi/i2c connected uart,
written for a colleague to test the sc16is750 in one of his designs
and developed using a SparkFun SC16IS750 module.

Tested using both the i2c and the spi interface of a raspberry pi,
because that's my canonical testing platform... :-)

Usage: ./sc16is7xx_demo [options]
  -d  DEV    i2c or spi device node (df: /dev/i2c-0)
  -a  ADDR   select i2c address (0 = spi, def: 77)
  -b  BAUD   select baudrate (df: 115200)
  -g  0xNN    set gpio port to value N

If your sc16is750 module is connected via spi, then run...

	./sc16is7xx_demo -d /dev/spidev-0.0 -a0

...or if it's connected via i2c, then run...

	./sc16is7xx_demo -d /dev/i2c-0 -a 0xADDR

The program will print 

	Virtual terminal is /dev/pts/1.

and to that terminal you'll connect with a terminal program like 'cu'.

	cu -l /dev/pts/1

Whatever you now send on the serial terminal should be output on the
uart module, and whatever the uart module receive should be printed
on the serial terminal.
